# Google Closure Linter F/ Style

This is the Google Closure Linter with settings specific to F/ as they are applied across all editors. For more information on Google Closure Linter see the following:

The editors by default package their own executables, but feel free to grab the ones in the `bin` folder and install them for some CLI goodness.


## Changes

1. Don't break our balls on 80 columns, we set it to 500. F/ rolls with some big ass monitors
- Added a `bin` folder for the executables for `gjslint` and `fixjsstyle` install these in `/usr/local/bin/`
